Janeforth is a copy of Jonesforth containing my modifications and extensions.

Jonesforth is a brilliant forth tutorial by By Richard W.M. Jones,
It is available here: http://git.annexia.org/?p=jonesforth.git;a=summary

I didn't want to maintain the high level of commentary as I added
new features so I removed all the tutorial comments. If you are
looking for a tutorial go read the original Jonesforth.
If you are confused about what this code is doing,
go read the original Jonesforth. The original Jonesforth files
jonesforth.S and jonesforth.f are included here unmodified for reference.


Modifications:
 - all words are lower cased
 - 'depth' returns the depth in cells instead of bytes
 - .s  prints stack in same format as gforth, with depth and tos on the right
 - tick that behaves as expected in compile and interpret modes

Renamed words:
 dsp@ -> sp@
 dsp@ -> sp!
 tell -> type
 '    -> [']
 rsp@ -> r@
 [compile] -> postpone

added:
  nil
  2/
  2*
  lshift
  rshift
  [char]
  reveal
  recursive
