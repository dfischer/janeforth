Janeforth is a copy of Jonesforth containing my modifications and extensions.
originally cloned from: http://git.annexia.org/?p=jonesforth.git;a=summary


Modifications:
 - all words are lower cased
 - 'depth' returns the depth in cells instead of bytes
 - .s  prints stack in same format as gforth, with depth and tos on the right
 - tick that behaves as expected in compile and interpret modes

Renamed words:
 dsp@ -> sp@
 dsp@ -> sp!
 tell -> type
 '    -> [']
